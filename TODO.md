~~But why?
Well, if we want to have really smart AI we have to take almost every information we know about our world and use it while making decision.~~

~~Cost does not represent all of the factors we consider.~~

>~~What if your wife is ill and you have to buy some pills for her? They're more important than chocolate you want to eat.~~
